# TODO ðŸš§

Your new site is all yours so it doesn't matter if you break it! Try editing the code.

Reference the [MapBox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/) and [evolve website](https://evolve.com/)

Use [console.log](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log) liberally to debug issues

```js
console.log("Something happened");
```

Click **Tools** > **Logs** at the bottom of Glitch to see the log statement in action when you submit new colors through the form.

## Keep going! ðŸš€

Keep working on new cool stuff
